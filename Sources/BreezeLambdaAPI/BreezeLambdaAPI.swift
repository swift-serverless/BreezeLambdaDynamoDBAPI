/// Actor implementing a service which transforms API Gateway events containing BreezeCodable items into DynamoDB operations.
///
/// `BreezeLambdaAPI<T>` acts as a bridge between AWS API Gateway and DynamoDB, handling the conversion
/// of incoming requests to the appropriate database operations. The generic parameter `T` represents
/// the data model type that conforms to `BreezeCodable`, ensuring type-safe operations.
///
/// It supports standard CRUD operations:
/// - Create: Insert new items into the DynamoDB table
/// - Read: Retrieve items by their identifier
/// - Update: Modify existing items in the table
/// - Delete: Remove items from the table
/// - List: Query and retrieve multiple items matching specific criteria
///
/// This service leverages the `ServiceLifecycle` package to manage its lifecycle, providing
/// graceful shutdown mechanism. It internally manages a `ServiceGroup` containing
/// a `BreezeLambdaService` and a `BreezeDynamoDBService`, which handle the actual processing
/// of requests and database operations.
///
/// The service is designed to be efficient and scalable for AWS Lambda environments, with configurable
/// timeout settings and comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging.
